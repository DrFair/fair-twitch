fair-twitch is a Twitch API and Chat bot library written in [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) for [Node](http://nodejs.org/).

Note: This was made for personal use, so it probably won't be supported that much. That being said, you can always submit issues and pull requests and I will look at them.

## Installation

Install via npm:

```
npm install fair-twitch
```

## Basic setup

Version 2.x is currently under development.
